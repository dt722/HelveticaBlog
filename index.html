          <h2>The Font That Changed How We See Things</h2>
          <p>If you’ve ever looked at a subway sign, a company logo, or even your phone screen, chances are you’ve seen Helvetica. At first, it might seem like just another font, but it’s actually kind of a big deal. Helvetica has been a huge part of design history and has helped shape how we see the world around us.</p>
          <p>It was created in 1957 by Swiss designer Max Miedinger, during a time when people were moving toward simpler, cleaner design. Helvetica’s neat, straight lines made it super popular with companies, governments, and designers who wanted something that felt modern and easy to read.</p>

          <h2>Where Helvetica Came From</h2>
          <p>Helvetica was made in Switzerland in 1957 by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas Type Foundry. It was first called <em>Neue Haas Grotesk</em>. They wanted to design something that looked modern and was easy to read in lots of different situations.</p>
          <p>In 1960, they changed the name to <em>Helvetica</em> (based on “Helvetia,” the Latin name for Switzerland) to make it sound more international. Its clean look made it perfect for everything from ads to signs, and that helped it become one of the most used fonts in the world.</p>

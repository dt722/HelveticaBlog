        <div class="collapsibleContent">
        <p>If you’ve ever looked at a subway sign, a company logo, or even your phone screen, chances are you’ve seen Helvetica. At first, it might seem like just another font, but it’s actually kind of a big deal. Helvetica has been a huge part of design history and has helped shape how we see the world around us.</p>
        <p>It was created in 1957 by Swiss designer Max Miedinger, during a time when people were moving toward simpler, cleaner design. Helvetica’s neat, straight lines made it super popular with companies, governments, and designers who wanted something that felt modern and easy to read. You can spot it on everything from New York City subway signs to big brand logos like IBM and Lufthansa. Helvetica became a go-to font because it felt trustworthy and simple, and it’s still used all over the place today.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why Helvetica Still Matters</button>
        <div class="collapsibleContent">
        <p>So, why do people still care about Helvetica? Mostly because it’s super clear and easy to read. Unlike fancier or more stylized fonts, Helvetica keeps things simple and clean. That’s why it’s used for stuff like street signs and business logos - it’s not distracting.</p>
        <p>Another reason designers like it is because it doesn’t have a strong personality. That might sound boring, but it actually makes it flexible. Depending on how it’s used, it can look serious, modern, or just clean and simple. It’s kind of like the Swiss army knife of fonts - useful in pretty much any situation.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Where Helvetica Came From</button>
        <div class="collapsibleContent">
        <p>Helvetica was made in Switzerland in 1957 by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas Type Foundry. It was first called <em>Neue Haas Grotesk</em>, and it came out during a time when people wanted more straightforward, no-nonsense design. After World War II, fancy and decorative styles weren’t as popular anymore. Helvetica was the answer to that change.</p>
        <p>Miedinger and Hoffmann wanted to design something that looked modern and was easy to read in lots of different situations. In 1960, they changed the name to <em>Helvetica</em> (based on “Helvetia,” the Latin name for Switzerland) to make it sound more international. Its clean look made it perfect for everything from ads to signs, and that helped it become one of the most used fonts in the world.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">How Helvetica Gets Used</button>
        <div class="collapsibleContent">
        <p>Helvetica’s simple, neutral design makes it super flexible. It can fit into almost any situation without standing out too much, which is great for getting a message across clearly.</p>
        <p>Lots of big companies use Helvetica because it looks professional and trustworthy. That’s why you’ll see it in logos for BMW, American Airlines, and Microsoft. Governments and public services also like it - for example, it’s used on signs in the New York City subway system to help people get around more easily.</p>
        <p>Designers use Helvetica in ads, packaging, websites, and apps because it’s easy to read and always looks clean. It works well in print and digital formats, and people see it all the time without even noticing it’s there.</p>
